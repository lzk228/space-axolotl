  # Cloning

  The magnum opus of any Medical department is [color=cyan]Cloning[/color]. If they manage to get access to the machines through [color=cyan]Salvage[/color], they have conquered death.

  ## Cloning Patients

  </Box>

  Assuming that the machines are built, cloning is relatively simple.

  - Hold [color=yellow][keybind="Use" /][/color] and [color=yellow]drag[/color] the patient into the [color=cyan]Medical Computer[/colo].
  - Press [color=yellow][keybind="ActivateItemInWorld" /][/color] with the [color=cyan]Cloning Console Computer[/color].
  - Insert enough biomass into the [color=cyan]Cloning Pod[/color] as is required.
  - Click [color=yellow][keybind="UIClick" /][/color] on [color=yellow]Clone[/color] to start cloning.

  If cloning isn't possible, the [color=cyan]Cloning Console Computer[/color] will display why it is.

  Additionally, there may be unpleasant results if the body has taken [color=cyan]Cellular[/color] damage or [color=cyan]rotted[/color].

  ## Setting Up Cloning

  <Box>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="ComputerCloningConsole" Caption="cloning console"/>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="MedicalScanner"/>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="CloningPod"/>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="BiomassReclaimer"/>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="Multitool"/>
  </Box>

  To set up Cloning, you first need all the necessary hardware.

  You'll need [color=cyan]Salvage[/color] to go out and collect the [color=cyan]Machine Boards[/color], as they cannot be researched by Science.

  Once they are collected, [color=yellow]build[/color] the machines, and then [color=yellow]connect[/color] everything to the [color=cyan]Cloning Console[/color] through the [color=cyan]Network Communicator[/color] or [color=cyan]Multitool[/color].

  Now you can clone!

  ## Collecting Biomass

  [color=cyan]Biomass[/color] is required to clone anyone, as you cannot create something out of nothing.

  The more massive the biological things you reclaim, the more [color=cyan]Biomass[/color] you will get.

  [bold]Do not use the patient you are trying to clone in the [color=cyan]Biomass Reclaimer[/color], as this will destroy their body and all their cellular information. Only do it after they've been cloned![/bold]

  If you are using a crew member, it is common practice to strip and return their equipment to their respective department.

  To reclaim [color=cyan]Biomass[/color]:
  - Acquire anything biological like a corpse (crew, pets, really anything).
  - Press [color=yellow][keybind="Use" /][/color] and drag anything biological into the [color=cyan]Biomass Reclaimer[/color].
  - It should reclaim about 40% of the biomass of the corpse.
