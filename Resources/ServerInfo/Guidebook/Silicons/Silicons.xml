  Assisting the station crew are a few varieties of sentient-brain or AI-powered processing machines, dubbed [color=cyan]silicons[/color].

  All silicons are able to communicate across the [color=#2ED2FD]Binary [/color]([color=#2ED2FD]:b[/color]) radio channel, a network connecting AI devices onboard the station to one-another.

  ## Laws

  </Box>
  Some silicons, particularly ones that can directly interact with the station, are bound by [color=cyan]silicon laws[/color] that strictly govern their behavior. These laws are designed to force them to act in the best interests of the crew, being based on [color=#a4885c]Asimov's [italic]Three Laws of Robotics[/italic][/color].\n
  [italic][color=#802924]Nanotrasen Inc. is not liable for any actions taken by silicons with damaged law states.[/color][/italic]

  ## Interpretation

  It is good practice to pay attention to [textlink="server rules" link="SiliconRules"] regarding silicons especially when playing a silicon that has [color=#a4885c]laws[/color], to ensure your RP and interpretation of your laws doesn't negatively impact others' experience on the server.
